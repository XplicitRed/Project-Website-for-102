<p>Cybercrimes can weaken the competitiveness of institutions and lead to long-term economic loss for companies, due to disruption of service, data breach, and direct financial loss due to theft and fraud. For example, malware will be a typical example. This is software that can enter a computer system and take advantage of system vulnerabilities to gain access to the computer system and to monitor user's activities, steal important information which can be used for trading intellectual property or assets, or threaten the company to pay for ransom payments or protection fee. Research shows that in euros, "7.4% of the businesses report paying fines or compensations up to €9999. In  1.2% of these incidents, the payments range between €10,000 and  €49,999."(Paoli.L, 2018) 

<p>Beyond financial losses, cyber-attacks can have profound psychological effects on individuals and communities. Victims of cybercrime often experience stress, anxiety, and sense of insecurity.  

  As Cybercrimes are less visible compare to physical crime., leaving victims a sense of helpless, feeling like they are been cyberstalked, unsure if or when will they be attack. Moreover members of certain community will be threatened or hated by extreme organization , making them feel isolated and limiting victims from accessing necessary supports for recovery. Which will lead to increase of anxiety and fear. (Rhoads J,2023)

  More importantly, cybercrime can destroy critical infrastructure and fail the operation and service of society.  
  
  Cyber-attacks pose significant threats to critical infrastructure sectors, such as healthcare service and medical system operation.  Due to low level of cybersecurity of network system, organizations experience an increase of ransomware  attacks or other cyber activities conducted by cybercriminals to steal or gain access to computer and network system.  This will cause critical files and data in the operation system to be encrypted or cause system shutdown. As a result, medical stuff and patients will experience delays in patient care  because of missing information for diagnosis, treatments and medical record, resulting death issue.
